                <h2 class="section-title" id="overview-heading"></h2>
                <p>The impeachment trial of Vice President Sara Duterte has become a major national issue, not only because it involves one of the country’s highest officials, but because it exposes how government funds—particularly those meant to support public education—may have been misused or mishandled.</p>
                <p>This investigation is taking place at a time when the Philippine education sector is struggling with some of the worst conditions in decades: classroom shortages, lack of textbooks, overwhelmed teachers, and crumbling school buildings.</p>
                <p>Many lawmakers and education advocates argue that the issue is not simply about politics. It is about the real, everyday struggles of millions of Filipino students who have to learn in overcrowded classrooms, share outdated textbooks, and study in unsafe, aging school buildings.</p>
                <p>At the same time, billions of pesos linked to the Vice President’s offices and past positions were allegedly spent with little transparency.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title" id="funds-heading">Misuse of Confidential Funds</h2>
                <p>During her first two years as Vice President, Sara Duterte accessed at least ₱612.5 million in confidential funds. These funds were reportedly spent in a very short time, without clear documentation or explanation. Critics say this is alarming because confidential funds are meant for security operations—not for administrative offices that do not have law enforcement roles.</p>
                <p>As Secretary of the Department of Education (DepEd), Duterte also requested an additional ₱150 million in confidential funds. This sparked widespread criticism because DepEd’s mission is to deliver education—not intelligence operations. Teachers’ groups questioned why the department spent money on confidential activities while millions of students lacked basic learning materials.</p>

                <p>Allegations of fund misuse did not begin at the national level. Reports show that between 2006 and 2015, during her time as Vice Mayor and Mayor of Davao City, approximately ₱2 billion was accumulated in several joint bank accounts under the names of Sara Duterte and her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte.</p>
                <p>This amount strongly contradicts her declared ₱13.8 million net worth in 2007. The large gap between her declared assets and the alleged accumulated wealth raises questions about where the money came from. Investigators say the lack of clear and consistent financial explanations adds weight to accusations of long-term malversation of public funds.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title" id="crisis-heading">A Deepening Education Crisis</h2>
                <p>While the Vice President allegedly had access to an enormous amount of discretionary and confidential funds, the Philippine education sector continued to suffer from major shortages and declining learning outcomes. Many of these problems have existed for years, but recent assessments show that they are worsening.</p>
                <p>Advocates emphasize that any government official handling education funds should prioritize the needs of students—especially because education is a basic human right. When resources are misused, the ones who suffer the most are children, teachers, and remote communities with the least access to quality education.</p>

            <section id="shortages" aria-labelledby="shortages-heading">
                <h2 class="section-title" id="shortages-heading">Massive Classroom Shortages & Learning Materials</h2>
                <p>DepEd reports a national shortage of 165,443 classrooms. As a result, many schools are forced to hold two or even three shifts of classes each day to accommodate all students. Teachers often report having more than 50 students in a single room—far beyond the ideal ratio.</p>
                <p>Only 30% of school buildings are considered to be in good physical condition. Studies warn that by 2040, more than half of the country’s concrete classrooms—and all wooden ones—will be unsafe or unusable if repairs and reconstruction do not happen soon.</p>
                <p>Even more alarming is the lack of fundamental learning materials. Data shows that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>95% of Grade 4 students attend schools where learning is disrupted due to missing or outdated textbooks.</li>
                    <li>20% of Grade 5 students share textbooks with one or more classmates.</li>
                    <li>Remote and rural schools face even longer delays in receiving learning materials.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because of these shortages, many students learn from photocopies, shared worksheets, or outdated modules. Teachers also spend their own money to compensate for missing materials—further stretching their already limited income.</p>

                <p>The ideal student-teacher ratio is 30:1, but many public school classes now exceed 40–60 students per teacher. The country currently lacks around 86,000 teachers. This shortage contributes to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overcrowded classrooms</li>
                    <li>Declining learning performance</li>

                    <li>4,300 repaired classrooms for damaged schools</li>
                    <li>71.6 million textbooks for students who currently have none</li>

                <p>For many Filipinos, this impeachment trial represents more than just political drama—it represents a fight for the future of education. When officials misuse resources, it directly harms students, teachers, and families who already face hardships in accessing quality education.</p>
                <p>Advocates say that letting corruption go unpunished would only deepen inequality and prolong the country’s education crisis. They emphasize that accountability is essential to rebuilding trust in government and ensuring that public funds serve the people—not political families.</p>
                <p>Many believe that if the Filipino public were the ones to deliver judgment, the verdict would be clear: Sara Duterte failed to protect the rights of learners and the integrity of public education.</p>
