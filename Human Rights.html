                <p class="lead">
                    The overall human rights climate in the Philippines showed modest improvements under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., although many long-standing issues remained. Killings linked to the “war on drugs” continued, though at a slower pace, and accountability was still largely absent. Despite the administration’s public commitment to uphold human rights, the government refused to cooperate with the International Criminal Court’s investigation into potential crimes against humanity. Meanwhile, abuses such as unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, and the intimidation of critics through red-tagging persisted across the country.

                <p>
                    Unlawful killings—both by police forces during anti-drug operations and by unidentified armed individuals—continued throughout 2024. According to monitoring by Dahas, 332 people were killed from January to November 15, with security forces responsible for more than half of the incidents. Since Marcos assumed office in July 2022, 841 individuals have died in drug-related killings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Attacks carried out by alleged death squads or hired hitmen, often riding tandem on motorcycles, remained common in Metro Manila and other cities. Political violence also surged in the latter half of 2024 as preparations for the 2025 midterm elections intensified.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In August, Congress began a joint inquiry into extrajudicial killings tied to the drug campaign, investigating whether funds from drug trafficking and illegal gambling during the Duterte administration were used to finance police-linked killings. Former police officials implicated ex-president Rodrigo Duterte and other senior officers in ordering the murder of suspected drug personalities while they were detained. Two witnesses also testified that they had been pressured to fabricate accusations against former senator Leila de Lima, who was detained for nearly seven years because of politically motivated charges.

                <p>
                    The human rights group Karapatan recorded 14 enforced disappearances since Marcos took office, including four new cases in 2024. Among the most recent victims were James Jimenez and Felix Salaveria Jr., who were reportedly abducted in Tabaco City in August. Many victims are activists, particularly those involved in land rights and environmental defense.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although the Philippines passed a law against enforced disappearances in 2012, the government has not effectively implemented it and has not allocated funds for its enforcement. The country also has not signed or ratified the international treaty that protects all individuals from enforced disappearance.

                <p>
                    Accusations of being communist rebels or supporters—known as red-tagging—remained widespread. This tactic, often spread through media and online platforms, intimidates individuals and shrinks civic spaces. It has increasingly targeted Indigenous leaders, educators, land rights defenders, and labor organizers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), operating under the Office of the President, continues to be a major driver of red-tagging incidents. In a landmark decision in May, the Supreme Court ruled that red-tagging endangers the right to life, liberty, and security.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Authorities have also escalated the use of the Anti-Terror Act, filing terrorism-related charges—including alleged terrorist financing—against activists and civil society groups. This expanded practice, known as “terror-tagging,” has resulted in court cases, though at least 22 have been dismissed. In May, child-rights advocate Maria Salome Ujano was convicted of rebellion.

                    Former senator Leila de Lima was released on bail in November 2023 after nearly seven years of detention. Her remaining cases were later dismissed in June. While Duterte’s government aggressively used fabricated charges to silence critics, similar patterns continued under Marcos.

                    In July, two left-leaning lawmakers and 11 teachers were convicted of child abuse after aiding Indigenous children in conflict-affected areas—charges widely viewed as politically motivated. In another case, four land and environmental defenders were arrested in August on allegations of possessing firearms and explosives; they claimed they were tortured.

                    Meaningful accountability for drug-related killings remains rare. In June, four police officers were convicted for murdering a father and son, bringing the total number of convictions for extrajudicial killings to just a handful.

                    The United Nations Joint Program on Human Rights, established in response to the drug war, ended in July. While the government celebrated its completion, civil society groups criticized it for failing to address accountability.

                    For the first time, Congress launched an official investigation into the thousands of killings linked to the drug war. During hearings from August to November, police officials admitted that the Duterte administration ordered the execution of drug suspects, including three alleged Chinese drug lords killed while in detention.

                    In July, the government held a national summit with UN agencies and civil society groups to discuss major changes to its drug laws. President Marcos announced a “paradigm shift” in drug policy, but the direction and specifics of reforms remained unclear.
